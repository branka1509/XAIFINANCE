<p>Even though many of the classical XAI approaches can lead to valuable insights about the modelsâ€™ inner workings, in most cases these techniques are not tailored for time series applications due to the presence of possibly complex and non-stationary dependence structure of the data.</p>
<p>Specifically, perturbation-based methods are fully dependent on the ability to perturb samples in a meaningful way. In the context of financial data:</p>
<ul>
<li>if features are correlated, the artificial coalitions created will lie outside of the multivariate joint distribution of the data,</li>
<li>if the data are independent, coalitions/generated data points can still be meaningless; </li>
<li>generating artificial data points through random replacement disregards the time sequence hence producing unrealistic values for the feature of interest.</li>
</ul>
