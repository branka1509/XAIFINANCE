<p>While it is often understood that risk-management (RM) concerns a mitigation of risk by means of diversification (central limit theorem), we here propose a more direct approach towards risk by identifying ’uncertain times’ or ’unusual states’ of the market in real-time</p>
<ul>
<li>Unusual states are identified by episodes during which the dependence structure, as measured by the LPD, is weak.</li>
<li>Uncertain times are identified by episodes during which the random nets are inconclusive about the local linear model i.e. times at which the standard deviations σt of the random samples of LPD- (or QPD-) realizations are large.</li>
</ul>
