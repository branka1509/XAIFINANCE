## Overview

This tab allows you to explore the performance of a simple neural network (NN) trained to predict the Bitcoin daily return by using 6 lagged returns as inputs. For this experiment, we choose a very simple architecture of the NN: 1 hidden layer with 100 hidden neurons. Hence, the number of estimated parameters amounts to a total of 6\*100 + 100 = 700 weights and 100+1 = 101 biases.

## Visualization of the trained model

## Trading performance

Next, we optimize the net 100-times, based on different random initializations of its parameters, and we compute trading performances of each random-net based on the simple sign-rule: buy or sell tomorrow's return depending on the sign of the NN's forecast. We further, compare the performance of the NN with a simple buy-and-hold strategy. The resulting cohort of cumulated (out-of-sample) trading performances is displayed in the Figure below with the mean-performance in the center (bold blue line). Remarkably, even the least performing net outperforms the buyand-hold benchmark (lower black line) in the considered out-of-sample span and the net-cohort systematically mitigates draw-downs of the BTC at the expense of slightly weaker growth during hefty upswings.
