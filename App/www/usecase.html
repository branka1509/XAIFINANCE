<p>Steps:</p>
<ul>
    <li>We train a nnet model</li>
    <li>We carry out an infinitesimal perturbation of i-th explanatory feature</li>
    <li>We obtain the predictions from the trained nnet model using the perturbed feature</li>
    <li>We collect, for each explanatory feature, the perturbated data and the corresponding nn-output</li>
    <li>We fit a time-varying linear regression</li>
    <li>We train the net for 100 different random initialization, and we observe the dependency of the LPDs across the
        different random nets.</li>
</ul>
<p>While it is often understood that risk-management (RM) concerns a mitigation of risk by means of diversification
    (central limit theorem), we here propose a more direct approach towards risk by identifying ’uncertain times’ or
    ’unusual states’ of the market in real-time</p>
<ul>
    <li>Unusual states are identified by episodes during which the dependence structure, as measured by the LPD, is
        weak.</li>
    <li>Uncertain times are identified by episodes during which the random nets are inconclusive about the local linear
        model i.e. times at which the standard deviations σt of the random samples of LPD- (or QPD-) realizations are
        large.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this context, a market-exit (cash-position) is triggered when the dependence structure of the data, as measured by
    the LPD, is weakening or, in other words, when the net-forecast is less conclusive about next-day’s return. In order
    to formalize the ’weakness’ concept we assume first that exit-signals have a probability of 1/7, one per week in the
    mean, which reflects the frequent occurrence of local bursts or disruptions of the BTC: a market exit is then
    triggered if the LPD drops below its empirical 1/7-quantile. The computation of the quantile is based on a
    rolling-window of length 100 days, corresponding roughly to the last quarter of observations: we argue that a
    quarter of data is sufficiently long for resolving the corresponding tail of the distribution, at least with respect
    to the 1/7-quantile, and it is short enough to adapt for possible structural changes in the BTC7. Finally, we
    cross-check the proposed RM monitoring-tool by analyzing crossings of the mirrored 1-1/7 upper quantile by the LPD,
    corresponding to unusually strong dependence</p>

<p>Discussion:<br>
    A direct comparison of market-exits in the figures suggests that weak data dependence (LPD below lower quantile)
    matches by the majority down-turns of the BTC and conversely strong data dependence (LPD above upper quantile)
    matches by the majority up-turns, thus confirming the original intent and rationale of the proposed RM-strategy</p>
